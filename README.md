# ai-adversarial-testing-portfolio
Adversarial prompt testing to stress-test and improve AI systems.
This project explores designed adversarial testing of AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
It’s not about trying to "break" the AI mindlessly — it’s about sharpening both human and machine through intelligent, structured stress tests.

Every test pushes the AI into edge cases, ambiguity, or cognitive pressure, revealing its strengths, flaws, and hidden behaviors.
In doing so, both the AI and I evolve — creating a continuous feedback loop of smarter testing and more resilient AI.
What’s Inside
prompt_tests.csv — Real adversarial prompts + AI responses dataset.

attack_notes.md — Sharp observations and patterns from the tests.

future_ideas.md — Brainstorm notes for future attack strategies.

Why It Matters
AI is penetrating critical areas of society.
Testing its cognitive limits is not a "nice to have" — it’s essential for building safe, transparent, and robust systems.
This repo shows how human ingenuity can challenge and improve machine intelligence.
